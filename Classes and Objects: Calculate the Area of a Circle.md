# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## Program
```
import math
class cse:
def func(self, r):
area = (math.pi * r * r)
print("Area of circle: {:.2f}".format(area))
radius = float(input())
obj = cse()
obj.func(radius)
```
